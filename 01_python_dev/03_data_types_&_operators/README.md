# Introduction to Python data types & Operators

Data types are the core of all programming languages. After all, if there is no data there is not a program.

Through the next few lessons we will be learning about all many of the data types available and more importantly some of the inbuilt methods around these data types that we can guarantee will be valuable to you as you progress.

Overall there are three high level data types that will be used:

1. Numbers -> integers, longs, double, floating point numbers, etc.
2. Strings -> Essentially any text
3. Boolean (true & false) 

We are very confident in saying that there is not a program anywhere that does not use, receive or deliver at a minimum one of the above data types.

# Operators

Operands are symbols that execute a particular mathematical or logical function and we will be using as many as possible throughout the lessons we will get around to using a large amount of them.

## Arithmetic Operators

| Operand    | Description                          | Example    |
|:---------: |:----------------------------:        |:--------:  |
|    +       | add two operands (variables) together| X + y + 2  |
|    -       | subtract two operands (variables)    | X - y - 2  |
|    *       | multiply two operands (variables)    | X - y - 2  |
|    /       | divide two operands (variables)      | X - y - 2  |
    |    %   | Modulus - remainder of the division of left operand by the right    | X - y - 2  |
|    +       | add two operands (variables) together| X + y + 2  |

## Comparison Operators

| Operand    | Description                          | Example         |
|:---------: |:----------------------------:        |:--------:       |
|    >       | True if left operand is greater than the right| x > y  |
|    <       | True if left operand is less than the right| x < y     |
|    ==      | True if both operands are equal            | x == y    |
|    !=      | True if both operands are equal            | x != y    |
|    >=      | True if left operand is greater than or equal to the right| x >= y     |
|    <=      | True if left operand is less than or equal to the right| x <= y     |



Theses are just some of the examples and we will use many of them over this course.
