# Collections Library 

We have been capturing a lot of data using variables throughout the course so far but it is quite limiting and more often than not we need to capture a multitude of data.

The collection library allows us to do this and we will be covering the below types:

* Lists
* Tuples
* Dictionaries
* Sets & Frozen Sets
