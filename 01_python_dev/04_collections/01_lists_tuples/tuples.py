# What are Tuple - the difference between lists and tuples?
# Why should we use tuple when we can store the data in lists anyway?

# Tuples: are exactly the same as lists although they are IMMUTABLE
# so the difference between lists and Tuple is that lists are mutable and Tuple are immutable
# Tuples are useful for unchangeable data such as - city name - DOB etc.
# Syntax: We use () parentheses instead of []

# Let's create our first Tuple

mendatory_items = ("paracetamol", "eggs", "milk")
print(mendatory_items)
print(mendatory_items.count("milk"))
# count() counts the number of times specified value occurs in our Tuple

# Let's add an item to our list "beans"
#mendatory_items[0] = "beans"


# Summary
# You just:

# Lists
# Managing lists and associated methods
