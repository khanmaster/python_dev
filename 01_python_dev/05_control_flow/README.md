Control flows are one of the most important aspects of coding and allow you to make decisions and actions against data and actions. It is possible to use them individually or mix all of them together and we will see how they can knit together during this section. 

When we use the term control flow we mean to flow through a particular decision making process, similar to when you turn up to the airport and wait for a gate number to appear before your flight or deciding in which queue to join at the supermarket they all relate to a control flow and the decisions made during it.
