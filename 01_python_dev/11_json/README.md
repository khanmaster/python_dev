In JSON, values must be one of the following data types:

- a string

- a boolean
- null

JSON syntax is derived from JavaScript object notation syntax:

- Data is in name/value pairs: - 

    `"Name":"Value"`

- Curly braces hold objects

    `{"Name":"Value"}`

- Data is separated by commas

    `{"Name_1":"Value_1", "Name_2":"Value_2"}`

- Square brackets hold arrays

    `{"Name":['value_1', 'value_2']}`
